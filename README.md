OpenGL-8-ball-pool-game
=======================

In this project, I build an interacting billiard game using modern OpenGL API. This game simulates a table with 6 pockets and 16 balls including a cue ball. The cue ball can be hit with a force using the mouse motions such that it gets an initial velocity. And the balls can rolling on the table by simulating friction. I also implement the necessary physics to modeling the collision between a ball and a sidewall, and between two balls. In addition, per-fragment shading is also implemented to achieve better lighting effect.
